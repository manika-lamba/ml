Abstract
"The MLIS curriculum gap and nonteaching academic librarian’s teaching identity development comprise the problem under investigation. The purpose of this interpretive phenomenological analysis was to examine the meaning of nonteaching academic librarians’ experiences in north and northcentral Florida with information literacy (IL) instruction, and beliefs about their instructional role given the lack of teaching preparation. An IPA methodology was used to examine the responses from semistructured interviews of five nonteaching academic librarians with MLIS credentials in north and northcentral Florida, including their shared instructional experiences about the role. An iterative data analysis method yielded four superordinate themes, including disorientation, induction, instruction, and librarian perceptions. The transformation of nonteaching academic librarians’ meaning perspectives and habits of mind about preparing for instructional duties is examined using Mezirow’s (1978b, 1998) transformative learning theoretical constructs: perspective transformation and critical self-reflection to focus the study. Findings indicated participants experienced feeling out of place or disoriented with IL instruction but credit their acquired instructional knowledge to peer interactions and professional development instead of the library science degree. Further, participants used informal teaching practices more frequently due to their perceptions about incorporating the framework for information literacy in higher education into instruction sessions. In critically self-reflecting about their instructional role, they transformed their perspectives about IL instruction from conflicting beliefs about formal methods and meeting the practical needs of students. This study illuminated the IL instruction methods nonteaching librarians use, their motivations based on shared perceptions, experiences, and beliefs, adding to the research literature about library instruction."
"This dissertation study aims to analyze the role of data-driven decision-making in sharing economy during the COVID-19 pandemic as a crisis management tool. In the twenty-first century, when applying analytical tools has become an essential component of business decision-making, including operations on crisis management, data analytics is an emerging field. To carry out corporate strategies, data-driven decision-making is seen as a crucial component of business operations. Data analytics can be applied to benefit-cost evaluations, strategy planning, client engagement, and service quality. Data forecasting can also be used to keep an eye on business operations and foresee potential risks. Risk Management and planning are essential for allocating the necessary resources with minimal cost and time and to be ready for a crisis. Hidden market trends and customer preferences can help companies make knowledgeable business decisions during crises and recessions. Each company should manage operations and response during emergencies, a path to recovery, and prepare for future similar events with appropriate data management tools. Sharing economy is part of social commerce, that brings together individuals who have underused assets and who want to rent those assets short-term. COVID-19 has emphasized the need for digital transformation. Since the pandemic began, the sharing economy has been facing challenges, while market demand dropped significantly. Shelter-in-Place and Stay-at-Home orders changed the way of offering such sharing services. Stricter safety procedures and the need for a strong balance sheet are the key take points to surviving during this difficult health crisis. Predictive analytics and peer-reviewed articles are used to assess the pandemic's effects. The approaches chosen to assess the research objectives and the research questions are the predictive financial performance of Uber &amp; Airbnb, bibliographic coupling, and keyword occurrence analyses of peer-reviewed works about the influence of data analytics on the sharing economy. The VOSViewer Bibliometric software program is utilized for computing bibliometric analysis, RapidMiner Predictive Data Analytics for computing data analytics, and LucidChart for visualizing data."
"In 2005, Dale Dougherty and O’Reilly Media founded Make Magazine, and coined the term Makerspace, which is broadly defined as a community workspace where people come together to solve problems using materials and tools they might otherwise not have access to (Dougherty, 2012). Recently, schools have allocated funding and resources into creating and maintaining maker programs in classrooms and libraries. Despite the overwhelming discussion of making and makerspaces in library practitioner-oriented publications, there is little scholarly discussion of maker programs in PreK-12 school libraries. This research addresses that gap by examining makerspaces in libraries in PreK-12 public schools in New York State using an embedded case study approach. This study positions makerspaces as an innovation in school libraries and examines the drivers and consequences of implementation. Two qualitative data sets are used in this study: open ended responses from a survey of school librarians and transcripts of semi-structured interviews with school librarians and other school personnel where maker programs have been implemented in the library. The analysis shows that there are two main drivers of maker program adoption: 1) the beliefs of school librarians, and 2) the visibility of maker programs in communication channels. The analysis shows five desirable consequences: 1) improved social emotional skills for students, 2) changing perceptions of school libraries, as well as 3) school and learning, 4) increased usage of the library, and 5) increased support for student learning through a) improved resource access and utilization, b) improved relationships with students, and c) increased collaboration with teachers. The analysis further identifies two unanticipated, but desirable consequences: 1) a change in attitudes and beliefs of school librarians and other educators, and 2) school librarians positioned as change agents. The analysis identifies three main undesirable consequences: 1) increased workload for school librarians and others in the school, 2) changing financial costs for the school and librarian, and 3) increased risk. These consequences are related to a) obtaining, managing, and maintaining materials and equipment, b) designing and implementing activities, c) renovating or modifying the library space, and d) training.The results indicate that maker programs have far reaching consequences, and the potential to affect not only students, but also librarians, libraries, schools, and the wider community. The results of this study have several important implications for future research, as well as for practitioners."
"In current news media environments where the separation between fact and opinion is blurred, it is important to understand college students’ media literacy practices and variables that may affect how they discern fake news. The purpose of this study was to investigate variables that may be related to college students’ fake news discernment, inspired by Potter’s cognitive media literacy model (2004). The investigated variables included college students’ ability to discern fact from opinion, critical thinking skills, beliefs in their control over situations or experiences (locus of control), and the degree to which they engage in and enjoy thinking (need for cognition). The study employed a sequential explanatory mixed-methods research design that consisted of a quantitative study followed by a qualitative study. The survey quantitatively measured 296 college students’ fact and opinion discernment, critical thinking skills, need for cognition, and locus of control. Critical thinking was a variable positively correlated with the fact and opinion discernment, as well as the need for cognition respectively. Group differences in the fact and opinion discernment, locus of control, and need for cognition scores were found. The follow-up interview data with 19 college students further explained the survey results and their media literacy practices. They described how they discern fact from opinion and evaluate information when reading news online. They stated that polarized media environments and their prior knowledge made information evaluation difficult when reading news online. The participants also described the importance and motivation of discerning fact and opinion and evaluating information in news reports. The study findings inform considerations for media literacy education which strengthens students’ skills regarding fake news discernment. This study suggests future work that further investigates the studied variables, such as developing the fact and opinion discernment instrument with borderline statements and developing a media literacy model in the context of news reading."
"Emerging from the 1950s, Digital Humanities (DH) has gradually developed into an interdisciplinary research field between different research methods and conventions. As increasing numbers of scholars entered the DH landscape from various knowledge domains, scholarly discussions have concerned the connotations and extensions of DH without achieving agreement. However, these theoretical discussions failed to provide either empirical evidence to support their claims or sufficient insight into the shape of DH. In this dissertation, I aim to explore the current dynamics of digital humanities as a field from an empirical perspective, and particularly through the lens of inscriptions. Inscriptions have been widely used in science and technology studies to illustrate the disciplinarity of fields and as a vehicle to mobilize scientific communication. In DH research, visual inscriptions (e.g., visualizations and graphs) have been increasingly applied in both research output and process, creating unprecedented opportunities to use them as a critical indicator to examine the cross-field collaborations among DH scholars and the field’s evolution. More specifically, I take a Latourian approach to investigate how digital humanists, broadly defined as any researchers or practitioners engaging in DH work, leverage inscriptions as “immutable mobiles” to produce, transfer, and communicate humanities knowledge, both in research outputs and during the research process. I apply a sequential, explanatory mixed-methods design, quantitatively examining the use patterns of inscriptions in DH journal articles from 2011 to 2020, before proceeding to the underlying, implicit decision-making processes and practices of visualization among digital humanists of various domains, using semi-structured interviews. This dissertation contributes to scholarship in digital humanities, visualization, and science and technology studies. First, this dissertation offers one of the first empirical studies of inscription use in DH. The findings of the dissertation suggest a gradual evolution of DH into an empirical, data-driven, and formalized field, which, in the long run, contributes to a better understanding of the current dynamics as well as the future directions of DH as a field. Second, this dissertation develops a working taxonomy of inscriptions commonly used in DH research, contributing to visualization scholarship from the perspective of an under-evaluated research context and potentially accelerating visual data literacy among DH communities. Finally, this dissertation provides a basis for further cross-field, comparative research on inscription use, which has been a classic theme of discussion in science and technology studies that can also potentially contribute to research on scholarly communication and collaboration."
"With the ‘data deluge’ leading to an institutionalized research environment for data management, U.S. academic faculty have increasingly faced pressure to deposit research data into open online data repositories, which, in turn, is engendering a new set of practices to adapt formal mandates to local circumstances. When these practices involve reorganizing workflows to align the goals of local and institutional stakeholders, we might call them ‘data articulations.’ This dissertation uses interviews to establish a grounded understanding of the data articulations behind deposit in 3 studies: (1) a phenomenological study of genomics faculty data management practices; (2) a grounded theory study developing a theory of data deposit as “articulation” work in genomics; and (3) a comparative case study of genomics and social science researchers to identify factors associated with the institutionalization of research data management (RDM). The findings of this research offer an in-depth understanding of the data management and deposit practices of academic research faculty, and surfaced institutional factors associated with data deposit. Additionally, the studies led to a theoretical framework of data deposit to open research data repositories. The empirical insights into the impacts of institutionalization of RDM and data deposit on long-term data sustainability update our knowledge of the impacts of increasing guidelines for RDM. The work also contributes to the body of data management literature through the development of the “data articulation” framework which can be applied and further validated by future work. In terms of practice, the studies offer recommendations for data policymakers, data repositories, and researchers on defining strategies and initiatives to leverage data reuse and employ computational approaches to support data management and deposit."
"This dissertation explores gendering practices of visual information catalogers. The work aims to understand how catalogers perceive gender when describing persons within visual information. The qualitative study deployed queer interpretative phenomenological analysis to understand how catalogers think broadly about describing identity. The infused queer theoretical tenets helped to understand that while participants may not directly name gender as challenging, the conflation of gender into cisnormative monoliths (assuming every person's gender matches their sex-assigned-at birth) or silence around gender produce telling opinions concerning nonbinary gender. The research also utilized a Think Aloud exercise wherein participants undertook in-the-moment cataloging three moving images. One image represented “neutral” cisgender identities, and two clips represented subversions to gender binaries. Thirteen catalogers were interviewed, and data produced noteworthy findings. The small sample size reflects qualitative methodological priority regarding a participants’ intimate, lived experiences rather than aiming for generalizability. Catalogers describe work with visual information as inherently challenging since describing anything without context requires caution. Catalogers also noted hesitance around describing humans given societal complexities around identities like race and gender. Nevertheless, participants during the Think Aloud exercise relied on gendering as descriptive shorthand (pronouns, male/female labels) and only reflected on these presumptions when engaging with the footage whose contents challenged gender binaries. Implications suggest a need for inclusivity training catalogers around contemporary notions of gender. Further, given the impact of the gender non-conforming footage on cataloger’s perceived practices, another implication suggests value in increased access to and representation of gender diverse materials within cultural heritage."
"Instructional librarianship in public post-secondary institutions requires that librarians be responsive to a diversity of paradigms and student needs, including Indigenous contexts. Although constrained by institutional infrastructures, Indigenous research methodologies and epistemologies provide frameworks for Indigenous librarians and students to practice and support inquiry in ways that are responsive to their culturally-specific needs. Currently, research in the field of library and information science about how Indigenous research methodologies and epistemologies can support academic librarianship is limited, especially concerning how Indigenous voices can inform information literacy as a whole. For this study, 4 Indigenous LIS and academic professionals and an Apache-Comanche Elder were interviewed. These semi-structured interviews were then analyzed to better understand how Indigenous voices can inform information literacy in the public academy. Responses were coded using thematic analysis. Results demonstrate that Indigenous voices can inform information literacy in consideration of relevancy, value neutrality, positionality, through being critical of hegemonic infrastructures including technology, prioritizing native voices, braiding knowledge systems, and centering relationality. These results hold implications for strategic planning, curriculum development, and informing social paradigms that support Indigenous people in post-secondary education while addressing issues in modernity for the good of the whole."
"The American public library is a relatively new institution which has borne witness to rapid urbanization in major American cities and an evolving cultural environment. For some, public buildings in urban cores are often the only places people can turn to use the bathroom, stay hydrated, or shelter from the elements. During an unforeseen crisis, or a natural disaster especially, people may have nowhere to go other than public buildings. The complexity of a 21 st century life has nearly rendered the public library and its services obsolete due to changes in media in a world dominated by the internet and digital communications. Despite being heavily criticized, the public library has proven to be an essential tool for the public as it continues to adapt alongside it. Specifically in communities that are disjointed from ongoing and active development, public libraries tend to be dismissed as a useful resource, as they are often taken at surface level and do not receive significant funding. Previous generations of public libraries were developed on the principle of building a broad, general education for all, often working in close relations with adjacent schools and learning centers. Public libraries today are still keen on providing a general education, however, the internet has proved itself capable of fulfilling that role. As the internet has alleviated some of the pressure put on libraries to satisfy this educational mission, a growing emphasis is being placed on libraries to focus on the building of social capital for the community it serves. Vital life skills in a 21 st century American life such as cooking, budgeting, or filing taxes, are often overlooked, or not taught at all in today's American education system but are crucial for success. Newfound skills can spark hope and put power directly in the hands of people to make change and work towards building a better future. In an era when architecture is often dictated by business considerations, public space tends to shape into semi-private space, or disappear completely. The most marginalized members of society, who are also the greatest beneficiaries of public libraries, seldom get a say in the crucial decisions that shape their communities. As the public library evolves and continues to mold itself to fulfil new roles, it is imperative to build on principles of inclusiveness in a manner that celebrates differing notions of a truly public space."
"This qualitative exploratory study investigated the experiences, or the lack, of underemployed immigrants with limited job skills, limited income, and limited English speaking skills with public library services as they face many stages of cultural and informational adaptation in the United States. Their information needs are at first primarily for housing, employment, education and social services. In general, they came to the US looking for opportunities, and to be successful. Those achievement means finding good jobs, educations, skills, and greater financial security. Having greater options starts by getting access to information that leads to those objectives. Public libraries have provided many opportunities to millions of people in the US and, by tapping into individual need for information, library services have benefited communities across the country. US public libraries emphasized services to immigrants as an essential segment of their activities. This was accomplished by offering and providing immigrants with relevant need-based assistance, such as improving their job searching skills and learning opportunities. Services to newcomers are crucial aspects of most public libraries with significant immigrant populations. While the literature on immigrants in libraries was useful in guiding this research, the focus of those bodies of work did not necessarily address the information needs of under-employed, limited English speaking immigrants who may have or may not have used public libraries. Following two separate pilot studies, I was able to collect survey data for 30 immigrant participants. I then reached out to public librarians who serve immigrants and found they were very accessible online during the pandemic. I recruited 30 public librarians in the New York City area who were asked to take part in questionnaire, interview, and focus group data collection to provide librarian perspectives on meeting the needs of recent immigrants. The data from the immigrant surveys, the librarians’ surveys, interviews, and the focus group was analyzed and examined using principles of open coding. I identified 3 categories of desired types of library services, 3 categories of roles that public librarians play in engaging immigrants in their daily lives to meet their information needs, and 3 categories of challenging barriers public librarians face in providing services to underemployed immigrants. The research ends with recommendations for information professionals for improving the service provision models between immigrants and librarians."
"This dissertation is a study of how privacy as an ethical concept exists in two languages: Mandarin Chinese and American English. The assumption for this dissertation is that different languages will have their own distinctive expressions and understandings when it comes to privacy. Specifically, I have proposed a cross-genre and cross-language study to include two genres of language corpora for each of the languages: social media posts and news articles. In addition, the language corpora span from 2010 to 2019, which supported an observation of how privacy-related languages may have changed and evolved over the years. I took a mixed-methods approach, by using two computational methods: semantic network analysis (SNA) and structural topic modeling (STM) for processing the natural language corpora. When it comes to labeling and interpreting the results of topic modeling, I relied on external coders for labeling and my own in-depth reading of the topic words as well as original documents to make sense of the meaning of these topics. Last but not least, based on the interpretations of topics, I proposed four semantic dimensions and used these four dimensions to come back to code all the topics to have an overall depiction of the topics across these two languages and two genres. The four semantic dimensions, though were found present in both languages, have revealed unequal presence in the two languages. Specifically, the institution dimension has much more presence in the English language; and in the Chinese language, it is the individual dimension that is frequently seen across topics in both genres. Apart from topics, this different emphasis on these two semantic dimensions (institution and individual) is also reflected through the semantic network analysis of nodes where the nodes with leading centrality scores over the years in these two languages differ. After considering the limitation of the data in this study, I conclude by arguing that overall, it is more cautious and appropriate to understand the incompatibilities by saying the two languages differ by their emphasis on different dimensions. This study is one of the first empirically-grounded intercultural explorations of the concept of privacy. It not only provides an examination of the concept as it is understood at the current time of writing but also reveals that natural language is promising to operationalize intercultural privacy research and comparative privacy research."
"A lack of fundamental information literacy skills for college students can be a barrier to academic success. This study sought to investigate how the availability of asynchronous and mobile-friendly learning modules in Canvas impacts students’ information literacy learning and to improve students’ information literacy skills at a community college in California. In collaboration with faculty, the instruction technologist, counselors, and other librarians, a platform of asynchronous and self-contained information literacy modules was developed in the Canvas LMS. Participants and data collected in Cycle 1 consisted of interviews with early platform users and a survey of student opinions on information literacy. Cycle 2 Action Steps were designed, implemented, and evaluated to understand the efficacy and shortcomings of the information literacy platform and to clarify the outlook for the asynchronous information literacy platform. Participants in Cycle 2 included the Writing Center Director and students. Data collected included student learning outcomes and assessments, satisfaction ratings, one interview, and demographic/descriptive data. The Action Steps were: 1) Collaborate with students to identify new information literacy learning opportunities, 2) Collaborate with English faculty to embed information literacy modules, 3) Investigate the Writing Center’s use of information literacy modules. This study found that leveraging the existing technology of the Canvas LMS is a pragmatic and effective approach to extending information literacy beyond the physical classroom that facilitates embedding scaffolding of information literacy learning that may contribute to student success. Implications for the organization included the normalization of Canvas as the place students learn, the potential for future partnerships to embed and scaffold learning, and the need to invest in technology that allows for cross-department tracking of student learning."
"One of the main objectives of search systems is to improve the quality of the user experience by providing search results that are relevant to the user's information need. Providing a diverse set of search results contribute to the quality of service of a search system as it increases the possibility of satisfying the user's information need. Although literature suggests that diversification techniques are used for the Web search, they are not applied often to non-free text search systems. In this work, we propose a diversified search framework for library catalog search systems. The work presented here is tested on a real-world dataset acquired from the National Library of Turkey. We have experimented the effects of changes in a wide range of parameters for our framework, testing the effectiveness, both in terms of search result diversity and result relevance. To this end, the proposed models adopt an automatic document categorization technique as a generic approach to the category discovery of the documents based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). For diversification of the search results, we modified and used a Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR)-based technique. The proposed framework achieved significant improvements on search result diversity (66.7%) while maintaining acceptable levels of relevance (1.9% loss)."
"The U.S. National Library of Medicine brought the intensifying interest in open science to national attention when it joined enthusiastic scientists to introduce and host an Amazon-like rating forum on PubMed—the world’s largest database of indexed biomedical and life sciences literature. The result was PubMed Commons. In June 2013, the commenting forum was introduced for open discussion about published scientific literature as part of a three-pronged approach to improve research rigor, reproducibility, and transparency. In Feb. 2018, the forum was unexpectedly discontinued. This retrospective explanatory case study research asked the question, “What happened on the way to the forum?” Answers came from a variety of resources using multiple methodologies for data collection and analysis. Historical data from PubMed Commons’ 7,629 comments and 1,551 commenters; key informant interviews with PubMed Commons editors; and a systematized search for published articles, gray literature; and social media content about PubMed Commons were analyzed using computer-mediated discourse analysis and a social network analysis. Results from the quantitative content analysis described a forum with little participation, and the qualitative content analysis demonstrated that active forum members were focused primarily on providing links to other information resources and discussing aspects of post-publication peer review. The social network analysis revealed a disconnected network, which was supported by a sociogram showing a community of independents with only seven small clusters. Findings pointed to 11 factors that affected the forum’s adoption and use. Rogers’ diffusion of innovation theory scaffolds a forum innovation agility model developed from this work to offer a better understanding of organizational processes and to aid organizations interested in introducing and managing a similar forum. PubMed Commons was a missed opportunity. No comparable alternative is available to promote open science and serve as a tool for the expected paradigm shift in the way we do scholarly communication in science."
"This study applies the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA) framework for eScience professionals to data service positions in academic libraries. Understanding the KSAs needed to provide data services is of crucial concern. The current study looks at KSAs of data professionals working in the United States academic libraries. An exploratory sequential mixed method design was adopted to discover the KSAs. The study was divided into two phases, a qualitative content analysis of 260 job advertisements for data professionals for Phase 1, and distribution of a self-administered online survey to data professionals working in academic libraries research data services (RDS) for Phase 2. The discovery of the KSAs from the content analysis of 260 job ads and the survey results from 167 data professionals were analyzed separately, and then Spearman rank order correlation was conducted in order to triangulate the data and compare results. The results from the study provide evidence on what hiring managers seek through job advertisements in terms of KSAs and which KSAs data professionals find to be important for working in RDS. The Spearman rank order correlation found strong agreement between job advertisement KSAs and data professionals perceptions of the KSAs."
"Digital libraries have become valuable learning resources for information users. However, language barriers have greatly limited information access for many digital libraries, as users do not understand those languages. This study explored technical and operational challenges digital libraries faced in sustaining multilinguality. Using the multiple-case method, the study investigated two digital libraries that have sustained multilinguality for over a decade: the World Digital Library and the Digital Library of the Caribbean. On-site interviews were conducted at both digital libraries and the related documents were analyzed. The findings of the study showed that the two multilingual digital libraries faced many technical and operational challenges and employed various approaches to find solutions. A model of challenges and approaches in sustaining multilinguality was presented. As the first such case study, this research enriches the existing literature, and has theoretical, practical, and methodological implications for the research of multilingual digital libraries. The findings of the study provide useful guidelines and insights for the digital library community in sustaining multilingual services."
"In the United States, many academic institutions are plagued by a history of anti-Black racism. Today, librarians from different racial backgrounds who work at libraries at predominantly White colleges and universities are given the important task of describing materials related to African American cultural heritage. This task has the potential to elevate Black stories and remediate misunderstandings of the African American experience, but the material effects of Whiteness loom over the process. First, librarians who describe African American collections bring to the library their own view and understanding of Black culture and history that may shape how they choose to describe materials. They are also professionalized into the library science field which itself is shaped by an Anglo-American worldview. Finally, they describe collections in predominantly White workplaces whose values and aims may or may not align with their own when it comes to representing African American collections in a way that is meaningful to them as people and professionals. Other scholars have written about anti-Black racism in libraries and library description. However, there has been less inductive research that takes a personal look at issues facing librarians from different cultural backgrounds as they describe African American collections in predominantly White academic libraries. I interviewed seven White librarians and two Black librarians who describe African American collections at libraries at PWIs about their personal values, their professional mindset, and how the workplace affords or denies them opportunities to create high-quality descriptions. Findings demonstrate that librarians believe personal experiences with Black culture impact their affinity for their work. Findings also demonstrate that although librarians believe in the rule-governed ethos of metadata and that standards are not wholly unfit for African American collections, that the absence of cultural literacy is a major issue. Finally, workplace impediments stand in the way of librarians creating resonant and thorough descriptions. I use the experiences articulated by librarians to suggest evidence-based best practices for library governance and library school educators at PWIs so that African American collections and the librarians who describe them can be better supported."
"Despite the city’s reputation as a culture dominated by the commercial entertainment industry, Los Angeles has had a long tradition of alternative and independent moving-image exhibition, developed explicitly in opposition to (or in tandem with) its Hollywood forebears. This thesis examines the history of alternative moving-image exhibition and provides two case studies of current non-profit media arts organizations, examining their respective approaches to curation, outreach, marketing, and governance, as a way of identifying sustainable approaches to alternative moving-image exhibition in Los Angeles. For each venue, unstructured interview sessions were held with executives and curators, identifying the organization’s mission, stakeholders and the communities that the institutions serve. I explore the way curatorial decisions are made, marketing strategies for programming, and the role of the board in each organization’s programming and operations. Finally, I argue that these venues represent a new model of exhibition that emphasizes a highly contextual yet inclusive approach to curation distinct from the dominant arthouse film culture."
"Web archives collections are an important site for preserving digital cultural heritage, capturing online resources and the underlying data of web pages and websites over time. This dissertation explores the data practices involved in the curation and scholarly uses of archived web data, and the emerging humanities research infrastructures that support this work. I focus on how data are created by and interact with multiple, varied, conflicting and often opaque systems from collection through to analysis and visualization, involving a range of actors and systems. Through interviews and observations in two settings centred on emerging research infrastructures from national libraries and academic libraries, I explore how web archiving processes involve technical systems that impose or manipulate data structures, as well as policies, legal restrictions, and a range of decisions and interpretations of the data made by the people involved in curation practices. My analysis is guided by the approach of infrastructure studies towards describing, documenting and contextualizing archived web data at varying scales and through their sociotechnical relationships. By studying these settings ethnographically, I seek to understand how data produced here are different from data produced there; in spite of the use of similar technologies and standard formats of data, I reveal how the particular contexts of these research infrastructures serve to shape the data found in each. I highlight the role of categories and classifications both in the construction of digital materials and the design and tailoring of computational systems. Ultimately, I argue that one cannot study, describe, or otherwise work critically with data without also understanding the classification systems and infrastructures through which data categories are developed and applied. It is in fact these categories of data that determine judgments and decision-making, and impact movement and legibility between systems and contexts; digital curation practices are in essence categorical work. I conclude by highlighting contributions to digital curation theory and practice and new directions for emerging work in critical data studies to consider how data categories are compatible or incompatible, and the complex sociotechnical relationships between categories, meanings and uses in data-centered algorithmic systems."
"Diversifying children’s literature has been a topic of discussion among American schools and libraries for more than half a century. An analysis of the research suggests that children benefit greatly from exposure to diverse books. Despite a significant amount of literature about this topic and an increasingly multicultural society, diversity inequities in children’s books persist. Given that diversity is articulated as a core value by the American Library Association (ALA), the lack of diversity in children’s books is germane to libraries. This study examines whether or not the policies that govern the selection of children’s books address diversity. Utilizing a mixed-methods (embedded) research design, a content analysis was performed on the collection development policies of academic libraries at universities that offer ALA-accredited programs in children’s librarianship. This analysis was performed to examine whether “manifest” messages of diversity exist in policies and the degree of congruency, if any, to the American Library Association’s (ALA) Diversity in Collection Development: An Interpretation of the Library Bill of Rights. A survey about policies was also distributed to academic librarians, at each of the universities included in this study, to provide a context for policies."
"The permeation of the spatial turn into the humanities, and in particular history, has both imbued scholarship and opened up new areas for research. This dissertation examines the conceptual and theoretical implications of advancing the spatial turn in history and evaluating existing approaches such as Historical GIS and ghost mapping as a foundation for deep mapping. The resulting deep map developed in this study utilizes Neogeography and web technology in the form of JavaScript Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to develop a prototype that overcomes many of the limitations that occur when simultaneously integrating multiple sources of data and software functionality, as well as qualitative and quantitative data. These are issues central to humanities scholars as they navigate multi-disciplinary narratological research. The deep map platform is a web application designed to enable a user to explore both spatial and temporal data through function calls made to multiple APIs. The result of these function calls are displayed in the web application dashboard as maps, text, images, photographs and documents. By selecting an event or time frame portrayed on a series of timeline bars, the user initiates the multiple API calls and is enabled to develop a series of spatial stories. The application is tested using a case study based on American western historiography and the work of Frederick Jackson Turner and the New Western history. In particular, the deep map centers on the westward frontier movement in early western Pennsylvania and (then) north western Virginia and discerns a north to south frontier movement that augmented the more commonly accepted meta narrative of an east to west settlement movement. Furthermore, the deep map examines the Martin family who were early settlers in Morgantown, (then Virginia). Through the deep map an examination is made of the Martin family and their slave Littleton who was granted his freedom in approximately 1812. Notably for the times, Littleton’s residency in Monongalia County was the subject of a series of petitions by both Littleton and prominent citizens of Morgantown for him to remain in the county and this at a time in American history when slavery divided the nation. The deep map advances the spatial turn in history by enabling historical events to be explored in the context of their spatial relationships using a methodology situated in applying APIs to the emerging field of deep mapping"
"This research explores faculty management of the tensions between academia and practice. Using a mixed methods design, it consists of three separate studies with a focus on Library and Information Science (LIS) faculty. Using an exploratory sequential design, the studies are intended to identify the ways faculty connect with practitioners, to measure the extent institutional pressures impact faculty inclusion in the practitioner community, and to determine the combination of factors that predict faculty integration of practice into teaching or research. This research consists of a qualitative, a quantitative, and a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Individual faculty are the unit of analysis. The findings indicate that LIS faculty maneuver institutional and cultural systems to manage the tensions between academia and practice. Specifically, faculty tap their intrinsic motivation, participate in boundary spanning activities, and understand institutional expectations. We identify four integrated findings: 1) Faculty are determined to manage the tensions between academia and practice. 2) Faculty need diverse and adaptable solutions to manage the tensions between academia and practice. 3) Faculty participate in boundary spanning activities in order to integrate academia and practice. 4) Institutional expectations negatively impact the ability of tenure-track faculty from managing the tensions. This dissertation contributes to scholarship and practice. Practically, this dissertation is impactful to higher education. These findings can simplify the integration of practice into academia and help faculty more easily manage the tensions in ways that are beneficial to the university, the professional program, the individual faculty, and the profession itself. Additionally, this research contributes to the literature on the role of scholar-practitioners and the value of employee authenticity within institutions. Finally, this dissertation maps the institutional effects on identity and reality using theoretical underpinnings from organizational institutionalism, social identity theory, and social construction. Thus, this research informs the literature on institutional sustainability and socio-cultural understanding."
"In today’s complex information environment, students are entering college under- prepared and lacking Information Literacy (IL) skills as they matriculate in STEM disciplines. Some universities have not developed effective systematic approaches for IL instructional programs to aid students in developing necessary 21st century IL skills. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate Information Literacy (IL) instruction and the impact it has on student achievement for students majoring in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) disciplines. This qualitative research followed a transcendental phenomenological approach by documenting and giving voice to the lived experiences of participants at HBCUs in a Southern state. Interviews with librarians, questionnaires prompting responses from STEM faculty and undergraduate students, along with a student focus group were used to collect data and develop a deeper understanding of the phenomenon of IL instruction in STEM disciplines. Findings, using Moustakas (1994) data analysis method, revealed four themes from responses to research questions: (a) desire to improve academic effectiveness, (b) need for quality instruction and development, (c) willingness to enhance collaboration efforts, and (d) awareness of opportunities to elevate. The results of this study will inform the higher education community including administrations, STEM departments, and libraries, along with accrediting and funding agencies about STEM IL programs at HBCUs."
"Data representation of diverse cultures, perspectives, and identities has stepped to the fore in society, especially with the academy’s increasing attention to diversity, equity, and inclusion. The failure to provide descriptions that are inclusive to diverse cultures and perspectives can hinder information access and raise ethical concerns. Information scientists and information professionals have identified problematic data representations and have advocated for changes to include diverse cultures, perspectives, and identities. Scholars have recognized various ways culture can manifest in knowledge organization (KO), such as through classifications, categories, and subjects. Previous studies use the concept of warrant, the justifications for classificatory decisions, to discuss the rationales for developing and applying KO standards. Cultural warrant is one of these warrants, and it is an approach to consciously account for culture in classification. In this dissertation, I expand the application of warrants from classificatory decisions to knowledge organization decisions writ large, including cataloging and data description. While culture is recognized as one of the forces that shape data work and KO, little work has thoroughly examined the observable manifestations of the concept of culture in KO. As a result, information scientists and information professionals are constantly reacting to issues caused by the lack of culturally inclusive data organization and description. To date we are yet to prevent the influx of bias and misnaming into information systems. The goal of this dissertation is to fill this gap by operationalizing cultural warrant in KO. Through analyzing editorial documents of KO standards developed at different times, in languages, and regions, and through prolonged ethnographic fieldwork, observing cataloging practices, I present an in-depth analysis of culture in KO. The dissertation provides concrete examples from literature, standards, and practices about how culture is woven into multiple aspects of data representations and KO, such as the development, application, and evaluation of KO standards and data practices. To operationalize cultural warrant, I propose three research questions. RQ1: How is culture identified in the knowledge organization literature? RQ2: How is culture manifested in knowledge organization standards? RQ3: How is culture manifested in cataloging practices? Through answering these research questions, the dissertation identifies prominent manifestations of culture that are common across standards and practices in KO, including conflicts and prioritizations of warrants, levels of standards and standardization, forms of resistance, and resources being cultural. These manifestations of cultural warrant reflect the perspectives of scholars, KO standard developers, and information professionals. Ultimately, this dissertation presents a literature-informed discussion highlighting specific dimensions of culture that are relevant to cultural warrant, an inventory of sources of cultural influences in KO, a list of manifestations of cultural warrant, and an explanation of how they play out. These deliverables provide scholars precise terms to identify, examine, and discuss cultural influences and cultural warrant in KO. Furthermore, by advancing our understanding of cultural warrant in KO, we gain insight into how and where to change our practices and standards in order to improve cultural inclusivity and create ethical data representations and KO systems."
"Although earlier studies have examined the online sexual health information seeking and evaluation skills of young adults, the majority of them are at least five years old and few have utilized inclusive, LGBTQ+-friendly language in their data collection instruments. This online survey study aimed to fill these gaps in the literature by conducting a more up-to-date study incorporating inclusive language, with the goal of using these findings to support the improvement of information literacy instruction. The findings suggest that the most popular online health information evaluation strategies amongst young adults may be unreliable and, while this population may understand reliable methods for evaluating online information in an academic context, they appear to struggle to apply the same critical information evaluation skills to their everyday life information seeking, thus providing support for an argument towards improved and updated information literacy instruction."
"Small business owners (SBO) do not generally think of libraries as business information sources, even though these organizations provide helpful business-related resources. Recent literature guides libraries about effective outreach to this community but offers little information about an emerging channel: social media. Therefore, we performed a comparative case study focusing on two public libraries in the Mid-Atlantic to investigate how they leverage these platforms to reach SBOs. We designed a mix-method study, including collecting qualitative and quantitative data from interviews and the two libraries' social media profiles. In this study, we found that the library, with a solid partnership with business support organizations, does not utilize these platforms as often. However, the library, which has recently started to support SBOs better, and has yet to strengthen its partnerships, leverages these platforms to reach SBOs. Nonetheless, the impact of using these platforms is still unclear, suggesting the need for future research."
"In the U.S., museums have long struggled with elitism and exclusion. Recently, however, the notion of inclusion has become a central and defining aspect of contemporary U.S. museological practice and thought. In 2018-2019 alone, a number of institutional and grassroots initiatives made strides towards centering inclusion in the U.S. museum field. For example, institutionally, the American Alliance of Museums (AAM) announced a 3-year grant initiative aimed to “provide the framework, training, and resources for museum leaders to build inclusive cultures within their institutions that more accurately reflect the communities they serve” (American Alliance of Museums, Jan. 15, 2019). At the same time, individual and grassroots efforts are many and varied. For example, museum leader, and public intellectual, Nina Simon announced her new initiative called of/by/for/all that will act as an “accelerator for change within the broader movement for diversity, equity, and inclusion in community-based organizations” (of/by/for/all, n.d.). While significant, these and other efforts remain disparate and, among them, present few explicit connections. Two interlinked objectives motivated this dissertation. The first was conceptual, and the second empirical. On the conceptual-level, I first discussed various dimensions of inclusion in museums in order to probe the question: •	How can systemic change centered on inclusion be brought about?I focused my discussion on the significance of inclusion to the museum field, its history, and who has been involved in conversations about it. In particular, I highlighted how authors such as Taylor (2017) and Taylor and Kegan (2017) put forth a whole system approach to inclusion in museums. Next, building on this approach, I developed a framework entitled Four Interacting Levels of System Change for Cultivating Inclusion. This framework is made of actionable strategies synthesized from contemporary sources on inclusion in U.S. museums discussed in the literature. To move the field forward, this framework can be adopted and adapted in practice.Next, on the empirical-level, I conducted a single, instrumental case study of The Incluseum, a project that I co-founded in 2012. Since then, it has become the longest run multivocal platform dedicated to ongoing, collaborative inquiry about inclusion in museums. My guiding research question was: •	What insights does the content of The Incluseum provide into the state of practice pertaining to inclusion in U.S. museums?Four main themes emerged through an inductive thematic analysis of Incluseum blog entries: Relationships, Social Justice, Representation and Access, and Institutional Change. Each is comprised of sub-themes. These themes are deeply interconnected and best understood as being part of one-another, as constituting a whole, or relational matrix. In other words, inclusion is best understood as existing at the center of this relational matrix; it is about the local interplay of these four themes. Looking to the Four Interacting Levels of System Change for Cultivating Inclusion Framework and the findings of this study side-by-side, we see a high degree of overlap, but must be cautious of their different orientation. More specifically, both present a whole-systems view of museums, albeit from different angles. The Framework takes an instrumental and solution-oriented approach to systems change, while the study’s findings are descriptive of a landscape and emphasize a relational approach to change with no clear prescribed method. The study’s findings point to a paradigmatic change from ‘power-over’ to ‘power-with’, which speaks to an ontological approach to inclusion; one that is predicated on a different way of thinking – a relational way of thinking. As such, care-centered values emerge as key to inclusion-related work.Importantly, the instrumental approach presented in the framework and the relational approach deriving from this study might not be mutually exclusive, but need to be contextually negotiated in practice. Future research can inquire about this local and practice-based orientation to complement the more common benchmarking studies that national groups like the AAM undertake. While this dissertation and its conclusions certainly have no pretense to close the book on the question of inclusion in U.S. museums, they have attempted to draw attention to and hold high an on-going process of collaborative inquiry involving many. This inquiry, both through the literature and through the blogposts analyzed, represents a rich diversity of museum practitioners and scholars, all continuing to learn through reflection and action. The dissertation provides perspectives from many voices, both conceptual and empirically. Its findings expand and strengthen the museological knowledge base with both conceptual and practical significance (Tracy, 2013). And, in line with Tracy’s definition of a “significant contribution”, it has served to “bring some clarity, make visible what is hidden or inappropriately ignored, and generate a sense of insight and deepened understanding” (ibid, p. 240)."
"Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 outbreak in December 2019, a large number of false news stories have spread on social media. And it has had a negative impact on the public health system. In December 2020, the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccine brought renewed confidence. To protect the correct information about the COVID-19 vaccine can be disseminated on the internet. I have collected a dataset of COVID-19 vaccine news and social media since the outbreak. I selected 80 highly reliable and unreliable sites from over 3700 news sites through three news reliability assessment sites, Medias Bias Chart checking, NewsGuard checking and Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC). I also crawled a dataset of tweets related to them. I analyzed the tweets data to determine the reliability of the tweets data by analyzing the news stance of the tweets data. I also provided statistical analysis and baseline performance analysis of the news dataset and tweets dataset. This dataset can be used for studies of the COVID-19 vaccine such as analysis of misinformation and impact of misinformation on COVID-19 vaccine."
"Collaborative learning helps university students improve their academic achievement, learning persistence and attitudes. Social media tend to have positive effects on collaborative learning by encouraging positive interactions online. Although previous research studies were conducted to explore the use of social media in education, there is a gap of studying the use of social media tools for collaborative learning. Motivated by the needs of using social media tools for iSchools students, this mixed-method dissertation research investigates the extent to which social media tools are used by iSchools students to facilitate their collaborative learning activities. Through an online survey with 222 students from 26 iSchools in 9 countries/regions, followed by 31 in-depth interviews with the surveyed people, the study investigates 1) the factors influencing iSchools students’ selection of social media tools; 2) the needed features and functions of social media for collaborative learning activities; 3) collaboration and communication strategies of iSchools students; 4) the impacts of design characteristics, usability, and UX aspects of the social media tools on iSchools students’ collaborative learning. The research findings reveal that iSchools students use social media well and have used various tools for group projects/assignments for a long time. However, the satisfaction levels and the perceived values of using social media tools remain neutral, because both benefits and drawbacks impact the use experiences widely and deeply. “Country” is shown as the major factor influencing the students’ use behaviors and perceptions, and open communication among team members brings the benefits and tackles the drawbacks of using social media tools for collaborative learning. In addition, a conceptual framework is developed to illustrate the collaborative learning through social media tools with the contextual and individual factors involved in the process. The dissertation research fills the gap of the existing studies with an overview of collaborative learning through social media tools in higher education settings. It introduces the commonly used features and functions for collaborative learning purposes, investigates the learning and communication behaviors, compares the benefits and drawbacks of using social media tools, and lists the related collaboration strategies. In terms of conceptual significance, the research study advances the understanding of the role of social media tools in collaborative learning; it deepens the understanding of the dimensions of collaborative learning through social media tools; and it contributes to the research studies in the fields of collaborative learning and social media with a conceptual framework. In terms of practical significance, the research findings may help with the improvements of social media platform and interface design with an overviewof the useful features and functions for collaborative learning, and users’ recommendations or suggestions for future social media developments. From the teaching and learning perspective, the research findings contribute to the design of iSchools course assignments and projects, that require actively using social media to support collaborative leaning."
"This dissertation is a constructivist grounded theory study of queer fans and their overlapping interactions with fanfiction texts, online platforms, and each other. Informed by queer theory, assemblage theory, and other perspectives from Library and Information Science (LIS), Media Studies, Fan Studies, Science and Technology Studies, and Gender and Sexuality Studies, I describe how structural power dynamics both shape and are shaped by inequities within information creation and associated online ecosystems. Findings and their implications address current limitations to both LIS and Fan Studies, especially in terms of the disciplines’ individualized and techno-utopian fallacies. I use constructivist grounded theory to qualitatively analyze and triangulate data from four sources: semi-structured interviews with 25 queer fanfiction authors located around the world, participants’ fanfiction texts, sociomaterial features of online platforms used for fanwork like Archive of Our Own (AO3), and platform policy statements. Analysis exposes complex sociotechnical assemblages that consist of people, technologies, and institutions involved in fandom. In explicating assemblages, I describe how marginalized people express agency via creative practices while they remain constrained by intersecting biopolitical inequities related to gender, sexuality, race, and nation. Findings suggest that tensions between agency and oppression are expressed in three domains: transforming bodies and feelings; forming community vs. forming cliques; and governing platforms and people. When participants read and write fanfiction, they transform normative canonical media in order to include queer embodiments and affects. These practices are reflected in fanfiction texts as well as platforms’ taxonomic systems. Participants specifically include information about queer bodies and queer sex in their texts, and tags on fanfiction archives often describe affects, or how a work of fanfiction may make a reader feel. However, data from participants of color, trans participants, and asexual participants demonstrate that fandom is regulated by whiteness and homonormativity. Transformative potentials in fandom are limited along biopolitical lines: the bodies and affects instantiated within fanfiction texts and platforms’ taxonomies are often the most normative within these queer spaces, while less normative standpoints are policed. Similar power dynamics extend to conceptions of forming community . Stark racial divides exist among participants: while white participants find community in fandom, participants of color are Othered. Further, complex “attention economies” develop in fandom. Though literature often frames fandoms as free of capitalistic dynamics, fans perform a great deal of labor to gain attention for themselves and their works. Despite the work a fan may perform to receive attention, logics of who and what become popular tend to reify normative racialized and gendered power dynamics so that marginalized fans are left out of arrangements that they refer to as “cliques” rather than communities. Participants describe debates over what is defined as “inappropriate” or “not safe for work” (NSFW) in fanwork. What is considered NSFW, and how platforms design ways in which people can avoid potentially upsetting fanfiction, are tied to historical constructions of biopower in fandom. For example, platform policies exist to moderate sexually explicit content, but not racist content; what is sexually explicit is also contested. Fans’ experiences are shaped by these policies. Platforms and their moderators afford white and cisgender fans more protection than trans fans and fans of color, who are often harassed when they share their experiences, and then held individually responsible for preventing people from harassing them. At the same time, moderators on platforms like AO3 are volunteers, and they describe their positions as callings or avocations rather than mere jobs or volunteer positions. Moderators’ perspectives mask both the labor they perform as well as the inequities they reify. The structural power dynamics described in this dissertation are transferable to other online contexts and populations, and they demonstrate that “information creation” exceeds a practice or suite of practices. Structural power dynamics cannot be eradicated via small-scale platform or behavioral changes because they reflect ingrained social inequities. To conclude this dissertation, I suggest that researchers work with marginalized fans in order to develop potential ways in which to de-construct biopolitics and progress toward equity in online spaces. I recommend three theoretical directions that future work may adopt in order to meet these aims: a) drawing on critical race theory, affect theory, and Black feminist epistemology, I recommend that future researchers center anger as a productive and informative emotion; b) drawing on queer theory, I recommend that future researchers reconsider and explore the myriad ways in which fandoms have failed despite their queer veneers; c) drawing on critical race theory’s intersection with socio-technical futurities, I recommend that scholars use community-based methods to imagine more just futures that do not follow normative or seemingly inevitable scripts for technology design and use."
"There has been an increasing expectation that the provision of health services should be based on evidence because evidence-based practice is an important tool for promoting quality care and improving patient outcomes. As undergraduate health science students transition from the classroom to the workplace they are expected to transfer elements of evidence-based practice learned in the classroom into their decision making and professional practice. Successful evidence-based practitioners, however, require a foundational level of information literacy such as effectively locating, evaluating, and ethically using health information. Learning transfer, however, is influenced by social factors in the workplace known as subjective norms. Subjective norms reflect an individual’s perception of social pressures to perform or not to perform the behavior. This quantitative study explored undergraduate non-nursing health science students’ perceptions of five subjective norm factors in the workplace climate that have been shown to influence their intention to transfer information literacy skills to the healthcare workplace. A 15 item survey, based on the Learning Transfer System Inventory, was used to collect data about these five subjective norm factors considered influential on intent to transfer. The five factors are: peer support, supervisor support, having an opportunity to use, openness to change, and feedback. Nineteen participants, or 10% completed the survey. The findings show that the most influential variables on intent to transfer IL/EBP into the healthcare workplace are supervisor support and opportunity to use. There is limited understanding of the influences on non-nursing undergraduate health science students intention to transfer information literacy skills into a workplace expectant of evidence-based practice. Results from this study have the potential to help both instructors and employers facilitate evidence-based practice by providing a student perspective about the transfer climate."
"This study focuses on the information practices of urban teens, exploring the types of information they are looking for in their everyday lives, where they go to get that information, and their views and preferences regarding digitally-mediated information interactions. Semi-structured interviews with six teens enrolled in schools in Brooklyn, New York, were conducted and the transcripts analyzed qualitatively through open coding to identify similarities and differences between participants. Findings showed a wide diversity of search topics and information sources across the participants. Their views on digitally-mediated information interactions fell into three distinct categories: preference for in-person, best of both worlds, and preference for digitally-mediated. This study was not intended to be generalized to a larger population, but the findings present exciting avenues for further research into specific source appeal, the impact of self-presentation on searching, and the impact of quarantine on teens information behaviors, among others."
"This case study used activity theory to explore how members participate in Wikidata and how they organize their work. This study addresses the need to have greater understanding of knowledge curation work in a large-scale peer-curated ontology. Wikidata is a free collaborative multilingual database collecting structured data for Wikimedia projects, which was launched in October 2012. It provides a centralized location for Wikimedia projects to query data allowing easier updating of information. According to Wikidata January 2021 statistics, there are more than 92 million items and have an active base of over 26 thousand people. Two sources of data were collected and qualitatively analyzed: discussion pages and interviews. Wikidataians are a diverse international group of people who contribute and use data for tasks inside and outside Wikidata. A mixture of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards was found. Wikidataian activities include curation, community building and usage of data. Six curation activities were identified: conceptualizing the curation process, appraising objects, and ingesting objects from external sources. These activities can be mapped to the earlier stages of the DCC Curation Lifecycle Model. Community focused activities are similar to Wikipedia. Wikidata has different kinds of communities: globally with other Wikimedia projects, locally within Wikidata, Wikiprojects, and short-term communications. Wikidata also interacts with other institutions' Wikibase instances. This study adopted Preece and Shneiderman's (2009) Reader-to-Leader framework to identify roles present in Wikidata. Many Wikidataians see themselves as a contributor or collaborator. However, many have informal leadership roles. The three types of tools identified in this study are Wikimedia hosted communication; non-Wikimedia hosted communications; and bots, scripts, and other tools. As Wikidata has matured the available tools have become powerful and user-friendly. Currently, Wikidata has two categories of policies and guidelines: behavior and content. The most important norm/rule cited by Wikidatians participating in this study was to use common sense. The findings of this study can go beyond understanding how Wikidata curates knowledge and potentially inform the design of other similar online peer-production communities, scientific research institutional repositories, digital archives, and libraries. Future studies could use other methods including quantitative methods to add more data points to further triangulate the findings. Since Wikidata connects the Wikimedia projects a study could compare research focusing on other Wikimedia projects such as Commons or Wiktionary to Wikidata."
"The information-seeking behavior has proven vital in understanding people's search behavior while seeking information about a particular topic or field. However, in some geographical regions, studies that focus on information-seeking behavior are few, specifically studying Arabic users' information-seeking behavior. A handful of studies investigate the information-seeking aspect of Arabic users, especially in the academic domain. Understanding the users' information need is essential to achieve satisfaction and provide reliable, easy-to-use, and intuitive services to users. This research focuses on the user's information-seeking behavior of the Saudi Digital Library (SDL). The SDL is the largest digital library in the Arab world, and it offers its services to Saudi students inland and abroad. This research aims to understand the information-seeking behavior and the needs of the SDL users and challenges they may face during their searches and report on how such difficulties may affect the users. It also aims to identify any challenges, either caused by the system or the users, and provide suggestions on how to improve the users' search experiences. Four questions have guided this research to report on the users' search experience while performing three search tasks with the user's choice of search term; an Arabic search task, an English search task, and a third task with searching in Arabic and English search terms. Applying the Stimulated Recall method, which involves recording the searching process, I recorded the screen as the participants searched the SDL, followed by semi-structured interviews where I asked the participants to report on their search process during each task. With a convivence sample, eight participants chose to participate in this study. Each participant's search experience has been investigated and reported on the challenges and the search behavior of each participant as individual cases. During the search process, I took memo notes of the participants' search process to record their behavior while completing the search tasks. Data were analyzed via NVivo 12. I found that the SDL search system lacks accuracy in finding relevant results in the Arabic search and suffers from accessibility in English. Users faced difficulties with completing the search tasks; some challenges were due to the search system, and some were due to the users' information search skills. This study suggests implementing a more robust dual-language search system to help Arabic users find relevant resources quickly and easily and help the users identify and fix search errors. Around-the-clock online support would help Arabic users feel confident that they will find the needed support if they cannot find relevant resources. The study contributes to the literature regarding SDL users' behavior and Arabic users' information-seeking, which is understudied."
"In a time of abundant information, misinformation, and disinformation, information literacy—the ability to find, evaluate, use, and share information—is a key competency for people of all ages. Traditional models of information literacy depict a universal set of skills that can only be learned via instruction from an information professional and must be used in a linear order. More recent models describe it as a set of fluid sociocultural practices that is unique to a particular context, shared by a group of people in that context, and able to be developed through both instruction and personal experience. One context in which information literacy has rarely been studied is that of the affinity space, an informal space—physical or digital—in which participants come together around a shared interest and learn. This qualitative research study investigates the information literacy practices of participants in the affinity space surrounding cosplay, a creative pursuit in which people dress up and roleplay as beloved characters from narratives such as television, video games, and comic books. The study used information horizon maps to ask participants to graphically depict themselves, the information sources they use for cosplay, and relationships between themselves and the resources, as well as relationships the resources have to each other. Through information horizon interviews, participants discussed specific cosplay-related information-seeking incidents and the resources and strategies they used to find the information they needed. Findings indicate that participants use a variety of resources, with all participants mentioning turning to other people for help. Participants also described using many different social media platforms, web-based resources, and events. Participants discussed the way they curate cosplay-related information and the role of trial-and-error in their information seeking process. Trial-and-error is not usually included in either traditional or recent sociocultural models of information literacy. This study suggests that future models should incorporate this part of the information-seeking process, especially when describing information-seeking and use in everyday life contexts rather than academic or professional contexts. This dissertation concludes with a set of recommendations for information literacy instructors to leverage interest-driven information literacy practices in formal educational environments."
"The vast amount of digital information, or “information overload,” has created challenges for information seekers, causing many users to unknowingly employ search strategies that compromise their ability to locate the best, most relevant information. One particular search behavior is called “satisficing.” Previous attempts to aid users’ searches have implemented various machine learning methods to link library records with Wikipedia articles to aid in the discovery of library items. These solutions provide important groundwork for this analysis, which aims to address issues of access users may encounter with library items, while identifying a method to generate keywords from one text dataset to serve as an index to describe a new text dataset. Specifically, the ultimate goal is to link openly-published, digitally available works with open-collaborative works, like Wikipedia. Item description and classification, traditionally known as “cataloging,” in the library field, is the manual means of accomplishing this type of task. The latent Dirichlet allocation, a natural language processing algorithm for topic modeling, holds potential for automating these types of cataloging methods. Applying the latent Dirichlet allocation to a dataset composed of 10,000 randomly sampled full-text articles from Wikipedia and another dataset composed of 10,000 article abstracts from the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) revealed that the full-text Wikipedia articles generated more coherent topics and that the extracted, weighted Wikipedia keywords, when applied to a new dataset composed of DOAJ abstracts, accurately described the primary topics within the abstracts. This finding indicates the strong potential for successful application of latent Dirichlet to link openly-published works to Wikipedia articles."
"The Internet is a common means for people to search for health information. The subject directory of MedlinePlus offers Internet searchers a browsing environment so that those seekers could start from a broad term and refine their search terms to meet their real information needs, thus resulting in a better information search. For those novice users who are not familiar with relevant domain knowledge, MedlinePlus’s directory can be of great assistance and enable the portal to adopt to a more general population. Such a subject directory system and its involved health topics in the MedlinePlus portal formed a network where a specific research methodology, social network analysis, is applicable. In this study, four health topic groups—mental health, children, teenagers, and older adults—were selected as the focus for the investigation toward the subject directory on the MedlinePlus portal. This study applied social network analysis to explore the health topic directories and connection patterns among the health topics that comprised the subject directory of the MedlinePlus portal, and identified the influential topics (i.e., those health topics which play more important roles than others in connecting different topics) among the topic networks. As a result, different recommendations were made toward mental health, children, teenagers, and older adults related health topics, respectively. New optimized structural networks were suggested to be built for each of the four health topic subcategories according to the similarity values calculated through the cosine similarity measure in terms of the textual information contained in health topics’ Web pages, as well as the key nodes identified in the networks of health topics. Evaluations were later conducted to compare the original and optimized structural networks of the four health topic groups regarding their topics’ new similarity values. Newly identified influential health topics were verified to have improved the overall semantic connections among the whole networks. Last but not least, the recommendation results were evaluated by two health field experts and the evaluation outcomes proved that the recommendations suggested in this study were consistent with the opinions generated by health professionals. The findings of this research will provide suggestions to optimize and enhance the current navigation guidance system in MedlinePlus, improve the information searching effectiveness among the portal users, offer insights to public health portal creators, and support other researchers focusing on subject directory systems."
"In the era of big data, large volumes of data are collected, communicated, processed, stored, and retrieved to enable a wealth of new applications in all facets of everyday life. The fine-grained collection of information and ever-increasing reliance on computing and networking systems comes with grave security and privacy risks at every stage of the data lifecycle. At the system level, such risks include data exposure, denial-of-service, and reduced network performance, to name a few. At the user level, security and privacy risks include the leakage of sensitive personal information to unauthorized parties, digital identity theft, user tracking, loss of financial assets, and others. In this dissertation, we focus on the security of two stages of the data lifecycle. In the first part, we study the implications of allowing multiple wireless technologies to coexist in unlicensed bands. In the second part, we study the potential leakage of sensitive information when users retrieve stored data from public databases. The unprecedented increase in the demand for wireless services has led to a severe shortage in radio spectrum resources. The regulatory solution for the scarcity of the available resources is to allow the coexistence of competing wireless technologies in common bands (e.g., the coexistence of Wi-Fi/Zigbee and LTE/Wi-Fi). This shared spectrum paradigm introduces novel challenges for the secure, efficient, and fair resource access. Many of these challenges arise from the heterogeneity of the coexisting systems, the system scale, and the lack of explicit coordination mechanisms between them. In this dissertation, we study the LTE/Wi-Fi coexistence in unlicensed bands as an example of heterogeneous coexistence. We develop methods that ensure fair and efficient coexistence. In the first objective, we consider the problem of fair coexistence between LTE and Wi-Fi systems in the unlicensed 5 GHz U-NII bands. We develop implicit sensing techniques that can accurately estimate the operational parameters of LTE transmissions under various topological scenarios and without decoding . These techniques apply correlation-based signal detection to infer the required information. The estimated parameters are vital in evaluating the behavior of coexistent terminals. Our techniques are validated through experiments on a USRP testbed. In the second objective, we focus on the misbehavior opportunities due to the heterogeneity in the channel access mechanism and the lack of a common control plane. We define selfish misbehavior strategies for the LTE that yield an unfair share of the spectrum resources. Such strategies are based on manipulating the operational parameters of the LTE-LAA standard. Prior methods for detecting misbehavior in homogeneous settings are not applicable in a spectrum sharing scenario because the devices of one system cannot decode the transmissions of another. We further apply a statistical inference framework for determining deviations of the LTE behavior from the coexistence etiquette. By characterizing the detection and false alarm probabilities, we show that our framework yields high detection accuracy at a very low false alarm rate. Although our methods focus on detecting misbehavior of the LTE system, they can be generalized to other coexistence scenarios. We further exploit the quick change detection framework to provide a method that detects any change in LTE behavior immediately after it happens. This method enables the Wi-Fi system not only to detect any LTE misbehavior but also to identify the exact misbehavior strategy adopted by the LTE. We further propose response strategies for the Wi-Fi system that equalize the channel access opportunities. These include a reflection strategy in which the Wi-Fi mimics the LTE misbehavior and a fair response strategy in which the Wi-Fi selects parameters that restore fairness. We study mechanisms for improving the coexistence efficiency in the third objective. We first study conserving energy when the wireless channel is occupied. In a Wi-Fi only system, the network allocation vector (NAV) included in the header of IEEE 802.11 frames advertises the duration of an imminent transmission. Nearby Wi-Fi terminals decode the frame header and transition to sleep mode to conserve energy. However, when heterogeneous systems coexist (e.g., LTE and Wi-Fi), frames that belong to other systems are not decodable. This leads to continuous channel sensing even when the channel is to be occupied for a long duration. We design two implicit mechanisms to play the role of the NAV. Our mechanisms predict the duration of an imminent LTE transmission by predicting the frame's traffic class. The prediction is based on the elapsed idle slots between successive transmissions and the transmission history. We show that our methods achieve significant energy savings without stifling transmission opportunities. Second, we investigate how the traffic class selection affects the delay for completing the transmission of a fixed number of bits. We develop an analytical framework that characterizes the average delay under Wi-Fi/LTE coexistence. Our framework allows us to optimize the class selection for a Wi-Fi or LTE station based on the traffic class selected by the surrounding stations and minimize the average delay. We show that operating at a high priority class does not always minimize delay. Under certain contention and class selection conditions, a low priority class reduces the collision probability while increasing the airtime once the channel is captured. This leads to a lower overall delay. In the second part of the dissertation, we study the process of privately retrieving data from one or more public databases, known as private information retrieval (PIR). Information-theoretic formulations of the PIR problem have been investigated under a variety of scenarios. Symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) is a variant where a user is able to privately retrieve one out of K messages from N non-colluding replicated databases without learning anything about the remaining K — 1 messages. However, the goal of perfect privacy can be too taxing for certain applications. We investigate if the information-theoretic capacity of SPIR (equivalently, the inverse of the minimum download cost) can be increased by relaxing both user and DB privacy definitions. Such relaxation is relevant in applications where privacy can be traded for communication efficiency. In the fourth objective, we introduce and investigate the Asymmetric Leaky PIR (AL-PIR) model with different privacy leakage budgets in each direction. For user privacy leakage, we bound the probability ratios between all possible realizations of database queries by a function of a non-negative constant ?. For database privacy, we bound the mutual information between the undesired messages, the queries, and the answers, by a function of a non-negative constant ?. We propose a general AL-PIR scheme that achieves an upper bound on the optimal download cost for arbitrary ? and ?. Second, we obtain an information-theoretic lower bound on the download cost. The gap analysis between the two bounds shows that our AL-PIR scheme is optimal when ?=0, i.e., under perfect user privacy and it is optimal within a maximum multiplicative gap for any ?&gt;0 and ?&gt;0. Finally, we study the Latent-variable PIR (LV-PIR) in the fifth objective. In LV-PIR, a user wishes to retrieve one out of K messages (indexed by ?) without revealing any information about a sensitive latent attribute (modeled by a latent variable S correlated with ?). We characterize the capacity (equivalently, the optimal download cost) of LV-PIR as a function of the distribution P S |? . We present a converse proof that yields a lower bound on the optimal download cost and a matching achievable scheme. The optimal scheme, however, involves an exhaustive search over subset queries and over all messages, which can be computationally prohibitive for large databases. We further present two low-complexity, albeit sub-optimal, schemes that outperform the conventional PIR solution."
"This thesis is an exploration of queer domesticity, queer possibility and intuition in historic house museums. It develops a methodological framework intended to intervene in archival, research, interpretive and institutional practices at these sites. Using the Elfreth’s Alley Museum’s podcast The Alley Cast as a case study, I examine how utilizing a framework that understands queerness to be just as possible as straightness; that uses intuition to guide research; and queer and trans theory to denaturalize categories of sexuality and gender can uncover queer domestic patterns that unsettle and disrupt the public’s hetero- and cisnormative assumptions about the past. I argue that this is a framework that can be adopted by historic house museums in order to engage with queer history when evidence may be lacking or whose historical subjects’ gender or sexuality resists easy classification. Finally, I argue that implementing such a framework can only be done successfully if it is engaged as part of a larger institution-wide commitment to creating a socially just and responsive museum that understands the importance of sharing complicated and difficult history with its public and dismantling its own position of power and authority."
"The rapid development of information technology in the recent years has added a range of new features to the traditional information environment, which has a profound impact on university library services and users. The Quality of Service parameter in library services has reached a broader consensus, which directly reflects customer satisfactions and loyalty. Exploring the evaluation frameworks for service quality in university libraries cannot be undermined in this context. Besides, existing evaluation frameworks of service quality of university library services are also facing numerous challenges due to their imperfections. Thus, there is an urgency and necessity to explore and enhance the efficiencies of the evaluation frameworks of service quality. To this end, this thesis conducts a systematic analysis of evaluation frameworks with a motivation of identifying the core components that needs enhancements for achieving effective service quality in Chinese university libraries through empirical methods. Furthermore, the inferences extracted from the analysis has been exploited to provide suitable recommendations for improving the service quality of university libraries. Firstly, through massive literature research and qualitative study, this thesis interprets the connotation and characteristics of the new era of information environment and further introduces the changes brought by the new information environment upon university library services and users. Then, the effects exerted by the new information environment upon service quality are analysed, and the formation mechanism, connotation and attributes are interpreted, which laid the foundation for the assessment scale and model construction presented in this thesis.&#xa0; Secondly, based on a modified SERVQUAL construction, an assessment scale for service quality in Chinese university libraries is built along with an evaluation of the validity and applicability of the constructed scale. This thesis developed a service quality scale through deductive and inductive methods of literature analysis, interviews with users and experts. The initially developed scale is then formally purified with 26 measurement indicators using the pre-surveyed data. The purified scale is further evaluated using data obtained from a formal-survey, and the validity and applicability of the scale of modified SERVQUAL scale has been tested and verified through&#xa0;confirmatory factor analysis, which provided an appropriate tool for evaluating the service quality of university libraries. Thirdly, this thesis establishes a hierarchical model for measurement and evaluation of service quality of university libraries and verifies the validity and consistency of the developed model, which proves that the developed model effectively overcomes the shortcomings of the SERVQUAL evaluation method. After a qualitative research, this study proposes a hierarchical service quality model for university libraries in which service quality is a third-order construct defined by two primary dimensions (outcome quality &amp; process quality) and five sub-dimensions (tangibility, reliability, assurance, responsiveness and empathy), this model effectively suits the psychological complexities of users whilst evaluating service quality. Empirical tests and interactive tests have also been conducted on the developed model through a range of evaluation methods such as structural equation modeling, three-stage test and partial dispersion technology, which verified the validity and stability of the proposed model for the assessment of service quality of university libraries.&#xa0; Finally, the thesis explored the application of the assessment scale and model for service quality of university libraries based on the modified SERVQUAL construct on service quality improvement. A variety of methods of quantitative analysis and evaluation has been used to analyse the current situation of university libraries. Based on this evaluation, improvement measures and promotion strategies are recommended to improve the service quality of Chinese university libraries."
"This study explores the experience of Generation X women who play casual video games on mobile devices (e. g., smartphones and tablets), and draws connections to learning and literacy, particularly in the areas of New Literacies, the New Literacy Studies, and semiotic literacy. Data was gathered from in-depth, semi-structured interviews with five women born between 1968 and 1971, and analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). An additional visual data analysis method was used to analyze photos taken of subjects in situ. Subjects downloaded and played an unknown to them casual game and then proceeded to play while engaging in a talk aloud methodology. Data from the talk aloud was then compared to five learning principles for video games as developed by learning theorist James Paul Gee.The study found that casual games are a form of learning and the casual game domain is a learning environment. For the women in the study, casual games are a place of agency, control, and empowerment; entering a game world is a retreat to a place of order. Casual games are a feminine realm where the subjects express themselves as creative, feminine people, embrace their intelligence, and socialize with others, in a separate realm that does not intrude upon the rest of their lives. Subjects in the study all demonstrated that their gameplay with casual games does correlate with Gee’s learning principles. This study extends Gee’s theories and adds to the research available on casual games. The study ends with suggestions for future research directions."
